## Setup Instructions

### 1. Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Set Up API Key

Create a `.env` file and add your Anthropic API key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual Anthropic API key.

Get your API key from: https://console.anthropic.com/

### 3. Run the Agent

Using environment variables:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-key' OS_SECURITY_KEY='omnigpt' ./venv/bin/uvicorn agno_agent:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

Or export them first:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-key'
export OS_SECURITY_KEY='omnigpt'
./venv/bin/uvicorn agno_agent:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

The agent will start running on http://localhost:8000 with hot-reload enabled.

## 🚀 Product Lead Agent (Enhanced)

**The ultimate orchestrator** - Talk to one agent that manages the entire software development process.

### Features:
- **Automated Workflow Orchestration** - Triggers complete software development workflow
- **End-to-End Process** - From idea to implementation plan
- **Nested Workflows** - Product Discovery + Architecture Design
- **File Outputs** - Generates PRD and ticket.md files
- **Conversational Interface** - Just describe what you want to build

### Quick Start:

```python
from agents.product_lead import product_lead_agent

product_lead_agent.print_response(
    "Create a blog post scheduling system",
    stream=True
)
```

**Output:**
- `prd_blog_post_scheduling_[timestamp].md` - Product Requirements
- `ticket_blog_post_scheduling_[timestamp].md` - Technical Architecture

See [SETUP_GUIDE.md](SETUP_GUIDE.md) for complete usage examples.

## 🔄 Software Development Workflow (NEW)

**Nested workflow** that combines Product Discovery + Architecture Design:

```
Product Lead Agent
    ↓
Software Development Workflow
    ├── Product Discovery Workflow
    │   └── Creates PRD (prd_[name]_[timestamp].md)
    │
    └── Architecture Design Workflow
        └── Creates Ticket (ticket_[name]_[timestamp].md)
```

### Features:
- ✅ Automatic PRD creation
- ✅ Technical architecture design
- ✅ Implementation task breakdown
- ✅ Conditional market research
- ✅ Pass data between workflows
- ✅ Persistent documentation files

See [Software Development Workflow Documentation](workflow_readme/software_development_workflow.md) for details.
